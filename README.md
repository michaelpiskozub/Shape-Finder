# Shape-Finder

Shape Finder is a final BSc project done in 2014 at King's College London. The aim of this project is to show a novel way of ﬁnding shapes in digital images. The solution presented here uses random walks (processes consisting of a series of random steps) and a range of ﬁrst order edge detectors (mathematical operators that expose regions where colour intensities change drastically).

## Manual



1. Click `Load Image` button to look for images.



2. The image will be loaded in the image viewer.



3. Optionally, choose one of the operations from the Tools pane.



4. Apply one of the edge detectors from the Operators pane.



5. In Traversal pane, tick `Enable` to turn on random walks.



6. Select the location and amount of random walks and click `Add`.



7. Once all random walks are finished the result will appear.
