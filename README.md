# Shape-Finder

Shape Finder is a final BSc project done in 2014 at King's College London. The aim of this project is to show a novel way of ﬁnding shapes in digital images. The solution presented here uses random walks (processes consisting of a series of random steps) and a range of ﬁrst order edge detectors (mathematical operators that expose regions where colour intensities change drastically).

## Manual
